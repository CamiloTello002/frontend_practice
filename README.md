# Frontend Practice
This repository is where I practice my frontend skills

## Motivation
I want to offer my web development services not only to a company, but also to small businesses. I already know about backend; I can make an API with Express.js and TypeScript.
But... Does it matter if the business owner can't see visual results? Of course no.

This is why I decided to practice my frontend skills as a backend developer; it will allow me to make websites visual-appealling.
